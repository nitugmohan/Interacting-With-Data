      <h2 align = "left">The Intersection of Voter Habits, Education & Income.</h2>
      
      <p align = "left">This plot demonstrates the cross-section between voter habits, education, and income. The relationship between voting frequency and education shows 
        that the majority of people who rarely/never vote have an education of high school or less. On the other hand, the majority 
        of people who always vote have completed college. For sporadic votes, the majority have completed college but the other half 
        have an almost equal split between some college and high school or less. Overall, we can see that people with more education 
        tend to vote more often. Regarding income, we can see a pattern in people that rarely/never vote: the majority of them make 
        less than $40k. For people that sporadically or always vote, their income follows the same pattern with the majority 
        making between $75-125k. Overall, we can see that people with higher voting frequency tend to have more education and income.

      <h2 align = "left">2020 had a higher percentage of absentee voters due to the pandemic.</h2>
      
      <p align = "left"> This bubble plot looks at the cross section of percent voter turnout and percent of absentee voters
        by region in Virginia. It is then further split into the data per year with a range of 2014 to 2022. The first thing
      that might stand out is the increase in height the data in 2020 has. This is explained by the Covid-19 pandemic.
      With more people staying home to quarantine, absentee voting was the ideal option. Thus there is an increase in the percent 
      of absentee voting.

      <h2 align = "left">Part 3</h2>
      
        <p align = "left"> This plot visualizes the percent turnout of voter across Virginia's different localities. From the map, we can see that 
          there is a higher percentage of voter turnout in the northeast regions of Virginia. Consequently, the southwest regions of 
          Virginia have a lower percentage of voter turnout. We can see this from Northeast counties like Fauquier County and Rappahannock 
          County having percent turnouts of 62% and 67% respectively. On the other hand, counties like Wise County and Buchanan County, 
          southwest localities, have percent turnouts of 39% and 33% respectively.
